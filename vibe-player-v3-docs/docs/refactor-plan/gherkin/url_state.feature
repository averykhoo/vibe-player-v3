Feature: URL State and User Preference Management
  As a user, I want to share a link that includes my session state,
  have the application load state from a URL,
  and remember my preferred settings between sessions.

  Background:
    Given the application has fully initialized

  Scenario: Application state is serialized to the URL query string
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/449496_9289636-lq.mp3" is loaded and ready
    When the user sets the "Speed" slider to "1.5"
    And the user seeks to "0:45" and then pauses playback
    Then the browser URL should contain "?speed=1.50"
    And the browser URL should contain "&time=45.00"
    And the browser URL should contain "&url=static%2Ftest-audio%2F449496_9289636-lq.mp3"

  Scenario: Loading an audio file from a URL parameter
    Given the user navigates to the application with the URL parameter "?url=static%2Ftest-audio%2F449496_9289636-lq.mp3"
    When the application finishes loading the audio from the URL
    Then the file name display should show "static/test-audio/449496_9289636-lq.mp3"
    And the player controls should be enabled

  Scenario: Loading a full session state from URL parameters on startup
    Given the user navigates to the application with the URL parameter "?url=static%2Ftest-audio%2F449496_9289636-lq.mp3&speed=0.75&pitch=-6.0&time=15.00"
    When the application finishes loading the audio from the URL
    Then the "Speed" value display should show "0.75x"
    And the "Pitch" value display should show "-6.0 semitones"
    And the current time should be approximately "0:15"

  Scenario: URL parameters are cleared when loading a new local file
    Given the user is on a page with the URL parameter "?speed=1.50&time=20.00"
    When the user selects the new local audio file "static/test-audio/IELTS13-Tests1-4CD1Track_01.mp3"
    Then the browser URL query string should be empty
