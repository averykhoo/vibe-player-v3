Feature: Playback Parameter Adjustment
  As a user, I want to adjust playback parameters like speed, pitch, and gain
  to change how the audio sounds in real-time.

  Background:
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/LearningEnglishConversations-20250325-TheEnglishWeSpeakTwistSomeonesArm.mp3" is loaded and the player is ready

  Scenario Outline: Adjusting a playback parameter slider
    When the user sets the "<Parameter>" slider to "<Value>"
    Then the "<Parameter>" value display should show "<Display>"
    And the browser URL should contain "<URL_Param>"

    Examples:
      | Parameter | Value | Display           | URL_Param          |
      | "Speed"   | "1.5" | "1.50x"           | "speed=1.50"       |
      | "Pitch"   | "-3"  | "-3.0 semitones"  | "pitch=-3.00"      |
      | "Gain"    | "2.0" | "2.00x"           | "gain=2.00"        |


  Scenario: Resetting parameters to default
    Given the "Speed" slider is at "1.5"
    And the "Pitch" slider is at "-3"
    When the user clicks the "Reset Controls" button
    Then the "Speed" slider should be at "1.0"
    And the "Pitch" slider should be at "0"
    And the "Gain" slider should be at "1.0"
