Feature: File Loading
  As a user, I want to load audio files from my computer or a URL
  so that I can analyze and play them in the application.

  Background:
    Given the user is on the main application page

  Scenario: Successfully loading a local audio file
    When the user selects the valid audio file "static/test-audio/IELTS13-Tests1-4CD1Track_01.mp3"
    Then the file name display should show "IELTS13-Tests1-4CD1Track_01.mp3"
    And the player controls should be enabled
    And the time display should show a duration greater than "0:00"

  Scenario: Attempting to load an unsupported local file type
    When the user selects the invalid file "static/test-audio/README.md"
    Then an error message "Invalid file type" should be displayed
    And the player controls should remain disabled

  Scenario: Loading a new file while another is already loaded
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/IELTS13-Tests1-4CD1Track_01.mp3" is loaded and ready
    When the user selects the new valid audio file "static/test-audio/dtmf-123A456B789C(star)0(hex)D.mp3"
    Then the file name display should show "dtmf-123A456B789C(star)0(hex)D.mp3"
    And the player state should be fully reset for the new file
    And the time display should show the duration of the new file
