Feature: Playback Controls
  As a user with a loaded audio file, I want to control its playback
  by playing, pausing, seeking, and jumping through the audio.

  Background:
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/449496_9289636-lq.mp3" is loaded and the player is ready

  Scenario: Play, Pause, and Resume functionality
    Given the player is paused at "0:00"
    When the user clicks the "Play" button
    Then the "Play" button's text should change to "Pause"
    And after "2" seconds, the current time should be greater than "0:01"
    When the user clicks the "Pause" button
    Then the "Pause" button's text should change to "Play"
    And the current time should stop advancing

  Scenario: Stopping playback resets the playhead to the beginning
    Given the audio is playing and the current time is "0:15"
    When the user clicks the "Stop" button
    Then the current time should be "0:00"
    And the "Play" button's text should change to "Play"
    And the player should be paused

  Scenario: Seeking with the progress bar
    When the user drags the seek bar handle to the 50% position
    Then the current time should be approximately half of the total duration
    And the player should resume playing if it was playing before seeking

  Scenario Outline: Jumping forwards and backwards
    Given the current time is "0:10"
    When the user jumps <direction> by "5" seconds
    Then the current time should be "<new_time>"

    Examples:
      | direction  | new_time |
      | "forward"  | "0:15"   |
      | "backward" | "0:05"   |
