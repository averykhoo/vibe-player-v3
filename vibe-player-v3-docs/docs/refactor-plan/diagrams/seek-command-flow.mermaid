%% A detailed flow for the seek operation, demonstrating the two-state seek logic
%% (`SEEK_AND_RESUME` vs. `SEEK_AND_HOLD`) to correctly handle play/pause toggles during the seek.

    actor User
    participant Slider as Seek Slider UI

    Note over User, Store: Initial State: PLAYING
    User->>Slider: Mousedown on handle
    Slider->>Orchestrator: COMMAND_BEGIN_SEEK

    activate Orchestrator
    Note over Orchestrator: State: PLAYING -> SEEK_AND_RESUME
    Orchestrator->>Store: playerStore.update({ status: 'seeking' })

    deactivate Orchestrator

    User->>Slider: Drags handle (oninput event)

    activate Orchestrator
    Orchestrator->>Engine: seek(newTime)
    deactivate Orchestrator

    activate Engine
    Note over Engine: Updates internal playhead.<br/>UI `timeStore` reflects change via 'hot path'.
    deactivate Engine
    
    alt User toggles play/pause mid-seek
        User->>UI: Presses spacebar
        UI->>Orchestrator: COMMAND_PAUSE (since original state was PLAYING)
        
        activate Orchestrator
        Note over Orchestrator: State: SEEK_AND_RESUME -> SEEK_AND_HOLD
        deactivate Orchestrator
    end
    
    User->>Slider: Mouseup (releases handle)
    Slider->>Orchestrator: COMMAND_END_SEEK

    activate Orchestrator
    Note right of Orchestrator: The reason for two seek states:<br>The Orchestrator now checks its current state.<br>If the user toggled pause mid-seek, the state is<br>SEEK_AND_HOLD, so it will transition to READY.<br>Otherwise, it's SEEK_AND_RESUME and will transition to PLAYING.
    
    Note over Orchestrator: State: SEEK_AND_HOLD -> READY (in this example)
    Orchestrator->>Store: playerStore.update({ status: 'ready' })
    deactivate Orchestrator
