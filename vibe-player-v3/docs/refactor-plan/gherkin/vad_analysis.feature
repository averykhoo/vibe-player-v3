Feature: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
  As a user, I want the application to automatically detect speech in an audio file
  and allow me to tune the detection parameters.

  Background:
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/IELTS13-Tests1-4CD1Track_01.mp3" is loaded and the player is ready

  Scenario: VAD highlights appear automatically after analysis
    Then the VAD progress bar should appear and complete within "15" seconds
    And the waveform should display one or more speech regions highlighted in yellow
    And the VAD positive threshold slider should be enabled
    And the VAD negative threshold slider should be enabled

  Scenario: Tuning VAD thresholds updates highlights in real-time
    Given the VAD analysis is complete and highlights are visible
    When the user sets the "VAD Positive Threshold" slider to a very high value of "0.95"
    Then the number of highlighted speech regions on the waveform should decrease or become zero
    When the user sets the "VAD Positive Threshold" slider to a very low value of "0.20"
    Then the number of highlighted speech regions on the waveform should increase
