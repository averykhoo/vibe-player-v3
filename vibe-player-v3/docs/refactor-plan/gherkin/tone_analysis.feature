Feature: Tone Detection
  As a user analyzing call audio, I want the application to detect and display
  standard DTMF and Call Progress Tones.

  Scenario: DTMF tones are detected and displayed correctly
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/dtmf-123A456B789C(star)0(hex)D.mp3" is loaded and the player is ready
    Then the DTMF display should eventually contain the sequence "1 2 3 A 4 5 6 B 7 8 9 C * 0 # D"

  Scenario: CPT (Busy Tone) is detected and displayed
    Given the audio file "static/test-audio/Dial DTMF sound _Busy Tone_ (480Hz+620Hz) [OnlineSound.net].mp3" is loaded and the player is ready
    Then the CPT display should eventually contain "Fast Busy / Reorder Tone"
